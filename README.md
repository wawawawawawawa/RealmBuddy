# RealmBuddy
This is my old RealmBuddy Script (1st version from Atredes!)
Tinyupload file got deleted, so putting it here on GitHub :)

It's a bit outdated, so some things are now kinda useless (mostly the cursor, apart if you want your own one, and the swap item)
That being said, everything works (server change, macros, right click change, etc.)
Although I didn't updated it with all the new shiny dungeons, but whatever, maybe I'll do it sometimes :P

Here how it looks like : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibfxBjEzx00
